Data Analysis and Outlier Detection
This project performs data analysis on various datasets, focusing on identifying and removing outliers using several statistical methods. The analysis includes techniques such as Percentile-based, Interquartile Range (IQR), Z-Score, and Standard Deviation methods. The goal is to prepare a clean dataset ready for further exploration and machine learning modeling.

Project Structure
AB_NYC_2019.csv – Dataset of New York City hotels with various attributes.
weight-height.csv – Dataset containing weight and height measurements for individuals.
data_cleaning.ipynb – Jupyter notebook with code for data cleaning, outlier detection, and visualization.
README.md – Project overview and setup instructions.
Techniques Used
Percentile-Based Technique: Removes values below the 1st and above the 99.9th percentiles.
IQR Method: Uses the Interquartile Range to identify moderate outliers by defining limits based on Q1 and Q3.
Z-Score Technique: Identifies outliers by measuring the number of standard deviations from the mean.
Standard Deviation Method: Uses mean and standard deviation to detect outliers in normally distributed data.
